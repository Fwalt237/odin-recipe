        <strong><em>Nota bene: </em></h3></strong>
        <em>Eru (Okok) leaves are difficult to cook, they must be soaked for 3 to 6 hours beforehand. You can also soak the leaves (Eru) for 1 hour of time and boil them with bicarbonate for 30 minutes.</em>
        <p><em>For one serving of Eru (or okok), use one serving of spinach or waterleaf. Also Spinach is different from waterleaf and for those who cannot easily find waterleaf, spinach is a good substitute.</em></p>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Wash and cut all your vegetables</li>
            <li>After cutting and washing the beef skin, boil it for 30 minutes then add the previously cleaned and cut beef. Don't forget to add salt</li>
            <li>Let it boil for 10 minutes until the meat juices form. Add chili pepper to it. Add the previously soaked fish at the end of cooking. You must keep the juice, it will be useful for the rest of the cooking</li>
            <li>In a pot, add the spinach or waterleaf. After 10 minutes, add the Eru and leave the mixture to simmer. Stir occasionally</li>
            <li>Add the meat and fish, stir the mixture and simmer for 5 minutes</li>
            <li>Then add the cooking juices and palm oil, stir and simmer for 15 minutes</li>
            <li>Finally add your crayfish and let simmer for 5 to 10 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
